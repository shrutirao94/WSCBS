1. Make sure you have a recent version of `node`
2. In a terminal pane, run `npm install` to install required dependencies
3. Next, run `npm run start` to start the server on port 8080
4. While in the same directory, run `calculator command number1 number2` to interact with the server. 
   `command` can by any of `add`, `sub`, `mul`, or `div`.
