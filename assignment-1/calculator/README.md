1. Make sure you have a recent version of `node`
2. In a terminal pane, run `npm install` to install required dependencies
3. Next, run `npm run start` to start the server on port 8080
4. In a new  pane, run `node client.js number1 number2` to interact with the server. 
   For example, say `node client.js 5 10`

Please note that any changes to server.js or spec.wsdl requires the server to be restarted.
