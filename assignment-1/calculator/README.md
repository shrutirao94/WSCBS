1. Make sure you have a recent version of `node`
2. In a terminal pane, run `npm install` to install required dependencies
3. Next, run `npm run start` to start the server on port 8080
4. In a new  pane, run `node client.js command number1 number2` to interact with the server. 
   `command` can by any of `add`, `sub`, `mul`, or `div`. 


### Examples
A few examples to denote usage:
1. `node client.js add  5 10`
2. `node client.js sub 100.5 200.67`
3. `node client.js mul  0 100`
