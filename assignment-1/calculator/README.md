1. Make sure you have a recent version of `node`
2. `cd` into the *calculator* directory and run `npm install`
3. Next, run `npm run start` to start the server on port 8080
4. While in the same directory, run `./calculator command number1 number2` to interact with the server.
   `command` can by any of `add`, `sub`, `mul`, or `div`.

A few examples to denote usage:
1. `calculator add  5 10`
2. `calculator sub 100.5 200.67`

Please note that any changes to server.js or spec.wsdl requires the server to be restarted.
